        <h2>The distant view</h2>
        <p>From the outside, web development seems like an ever-easier enterprise</p>
        <h2>The steep upwards climb</h2>
        <p>It is only once the underlying technologies are distinguishable that the truth is revealed: it's a wonder any website more complex than a WordPress template ever gets made at all.</p>
        <h2>The crowded peak</h2>
        <p>There is an upside to the horde of aspiring developers and the ever-increasing demand for more: there are plenty of didactic resources and specialised communities.</p>
